<p><b>UPPER LIST</b> - GUESS WORDS FROM HERE. &nbsp;1) If you get a word correct (GREEN), circle it; if you get it wrong, cross it off.  &nbsp;2) In addition, if it was GREEN, cross it off in the LOWER list since it is no longer guessable by your partner.</p>

<p><b>LOWER LIST</b> - GIVE CLUES FROM HERE. &nbsp;1) Look up color of partner's guess here and report it, then cross it off.  &nbsp;2) In addition, if they found a GREEN word, draw a box around it in UPPER list since it's no longer guessable by you.</p>
