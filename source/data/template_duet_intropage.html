<h2>How to Play:</h2>
<p>This is a two-player cooperative game. Each player has their own booklet, with one game per printed page. For each game, <b>players have the same list of words</b>, but the "colors" of the words are different for each player. Choose a starting player at random, then alternate turns giving clues.</p>

<p>Both players begin each turn by ticking a turn marker checkbox; if none remain to tick, the players have run out of time and proceed to Sudden Death (see below).</p>  
<p>The clue giver thinks of and announces a single clue word related to one <i>or more</i> words that are GREEN on their sheet, along with a number indicating how many words the clue refers to. Clue words may not be in the word list in any form and must relate to the meanings of words (you may spell the word). Their partner must then guess a single word from their UPPER list that they think is GREEN on the clue giver's sheet.</p>
<p>The guesser then chooses a single word from their upper list. The clue giver reports the color of the guessed word, as shown on their lower list.  What happens next depends on the color of the word guessed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the color is BLACK, the players lose the game immediately.</li>
	<li>If the color is YELLOW, the guesser is wrong, and the turn ends. Both players should tick a "mistake" checkbox, and if none remain, the players must tick an additional turn checkbox.</li>
	<li>If the color is GREEN, the guesser is correct (even if it wasn't a word the glue giver was thinking of). Both players should tick a "target" checkbox (if they are all ticked, the players have won).  The guesser may now, if they wish, make an additional guess (possibly releated to a previous clue!) and repeat the process above, with the restriction that the number of guesses on each turn cannot exceed the number specified by the clue giver PLUS ONE.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of a turn the partners alternate roles and begin a new turn (if all of a player's green words have been found, they announce this and no longer take turns giving clues).</p>
<p><b>Sudden Death:</b> If players run out of turns they enter sudden death mode. No more clues can be given nor strategy discussed. Players make guesses in any order, one at a time, in an effort to find all words. Any mistake ends the game with a loss.</p>
<p><b>Remember:</b> Clue givers can't give any indication about whether a correct guess was the word they were thinking of for their clue, and must refrain from any comments or reactions that could assist the guesser. Follow instructions to help keep track of which words still need to be guessed.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> Just because a word is black on your sheet doesn't mean you shouldn't guess it, it might be a green word on your partner's sheet; see the last page of the booklet for a description of how word colors overlap between players.

<p><hr/>&nbsp;<br/><i>Scoring:</i> +2 points per "target" found, +10 per unused turn, -5 per "mistake", -10 if sudden death.  Games ended by a black word score differently: -10 points for each unused turn, "mistake", and unfound "target".  Penalize illegal clues by ticking an extra turn and "mistake" checkbox.</p>
